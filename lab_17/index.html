                <p>
                  There was a village in a deep forest. There lived inhabitants of this forest. Some animals lived in piece, the other animals were always quarreling because of the lack of food. There were two snow white hares among them. Their names were Kate and Sophy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They were constantly quarreling and fighting. Once they had to go into the terrible forest to gather berries. They were going very long and sometimes they quarreled who would be the first to gather berries.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Suddenly they saw a bog. There was a small path behind the bog. There was the only mushroom in this forest on the path. Kate and Sophy ran to this mushroom, but they forgot that they could bog down. And it happened. They bogged down. The God of Friendship saw these hares and saved them. When Kate and Sophy were quarreling, who was guilty, the crow took the last mushroom for her children. They started quarreling again. They continued their way and saw a big tree, which had been fallen down. There was a small tunnel leading to the path inside of the tree. Kate told she would go through the tunnel faster than Sophy. And Sophy suggested to go around the tree, it would be safer. Kate didn`t follow Sophy`s advice and went through the tunnel inside the tree. And she fell in a hole.

                <p>
                  The God of Friendship saved her again. The God of Friendship didn`t like how these hares behave. And he decided to arrange an ordeal for them to make them friends, and to make them to respect each other. He left his tear next to the berry bush. The tear turned into the big river with a big waterfall. The God of Friendship told to hares: “If you don`t help each other to get over the river, you will not get any berry at all”.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Kate and Sophy didn`t want to follow his advice and went on their way as they wanted.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Suddenly the current became stronger and knocked Kate off her feet. But Sophy had time to snatch her at his pad. And she dragged her out of water.

                </p>
                
                <p>
                They went on and suddenly a big fish bobbed up to the water surface and swam toward Sophy to eat her. Then Kate grabbed a heavy stone and threw it into the fish. The big fish ate up this stone instead of the hare and got drowned in the river. After that they started to help each other to cross the river.
</p>
                <p>
                  There was a lot of ordeals on their way, but they overcame them together. When they came to the berry bush they saw the God of Friendship. He told them:”If you, hares, help each other, the life will be easier!” And then Kate and Sophy decided to be best friends and be always together, to help other inhabitants of the forest. The God of Friendship liked their decision and he told:”Till you live friendly, there will be food in the forest:berries and mushrooms. And he covered the forest with grass and flowers. And Kate and Sophy became masters of the forest. They looked after other inhabitants. They wanted nobody to live quarreling. The inhabitants of this forest were thankful to these nice hares for it.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Kate and Sophy showed them true life and besides they enlivened the forest. They changed the world to the best.
